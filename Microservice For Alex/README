HOW TO REQUEST DATA FROM MICROSERVICE:
- Run the server.cjs file. This file awaits for a 'POST' call, and generates the random string. To run the file, have node and NPM installed (for guidance: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). In your terminal, enter the command: node server.cjs.

HOW TO RECIEVE DATA FROM MICROSERVICE:
- In your client (main) program, implement the code included in the 'client.js' file, or use the provided 'client.js' file. If using the provided file, run it using a similar command to above: node client.js. This will require a different terminal.

EXAMPLE CALLS:
- Terminal 1: node server.cjs
- Terminal 2: node client.js (or some similar logic in your main program)
- The random string will be returned in terminal 2 (and will be returned as 'response' in the fetch request to be used in whatever logic).
